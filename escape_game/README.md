# üïπÔ∏è Tamagotchi-Style LCD Game (Arduino Nano)

A simple LCD-based game inspired by retro handheld toys, built using an Arduino Nano. The player moves a character (the "man") toward the doors on either side of the screen. Reach a door and win the game ‚Äî complete with sound and animation!

## üéÆ Features

- Character moves left or right using two buttons.
- Display uses a 16x2 I2C LCD screen.
- Buzzer plays a short sound on each move.
- Victory animation with melody when reaching either edge.
- Custom pixel sprites: man, doors, key, heart, boundary.

## üîå Wiring Guide

| Component      | Arduino Pin | Notes                        |
|----------------|-------------|------------------------------|
| LCD (I2C)      | A4 (SDA), A5 (SCL) | Use default I2C pins        |
| Left Button    | D2          | Uses `INPUT_PULLUP` mode     |
| Right Button   | D7          | Uses `INPUT_PULLUP` mode     |
| Buzzer         | D9          | Connect short leg to GND     |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Buttons are configured using `INPUT_PULLUP`, so connect one side to GND. No external resistors are required.
